================================================================================

SESSION: RESOLVE TOOL DESIGN
Date: 2025-01-11
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
AI agents (Claude Code specifically) stop and ask too many questions when
uncertain. This externalizes work the agent should do itself and kills flow.

ROOT INSIGHT:
-------------
There are TWO types of uncertainty:

1. INTENT uncertainty - "What problem are we actually solving?"
   -> Warrants asking (targeted questions) - prevents building wrong thing

2. IMPLEMENTATION uncertainty - "How should we solve it?"
   -> Should NEVER be asked - resolvable through context gathering

KEY PRINCIPLE:
--------------
Uncertainty should be RESOLVED, not EXTERNALIZED.

THE RESOLVE TOOL:
-----------------
A new Daedalos primitive that handles both phases:

PHASE 1: INTENT LOOP
- If intent unclear, ask targeted questions (not open-ended)
- Use AskUserQuestion to batch independent unknowns
- Loop until intent is clear enough for implementation
- Each question must be binary/small-set, show understanding

PHASE 2: CONFIDENCE (NO QUESTIONS)
- List "questions I would ask"
- Answer each through context gathering:
  - spec query (prior decisions)
  - codex search (existing patterns)
  - project info (conventions)
  - error-db (known solutions)
  - web search (best practices)
- Synthesize into decision
- Log to DECISIONS.md for institutional memory

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
- High: Proceed silently
- Medium: Proceed, state assumption
- Low: Genuine ambiguity, ask (should be rare)

INTEGRATION:
------------
- Orchestrates existing tools (spec, codex, project, error-db, web)
- Creates .claude/DECISIONS.md for project memory
- Invoked at task start, not just when uncertain

SPEC WRITTEN:
-------------
daedalos-tools/resolve/resolve.spec.yaml

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Implement resolve tool
2. Integrate with daedalos-mcp
3. Test with real development workflows
4. Measure reduction in implementation questions

META:
-----
This session itself demonstrated the problem. User asked about "hooks and loops"
but meant "systemic agent confidence." Intent resolution surfaced the root
problem before we solved the wrong thing.
