  # WHY does this tool exist?
  # What problem does it solve?
  # What experience should users have?
  #
  # This is NOT what the tool does - it's WHY it matters.
  # Example: "Users should experiment fearlessly" not "Provides undo functionality"

constraints:
  # Hard requirements - things that MUST be true
  # - Must work offline
  # - Must be < 100ms for common operations
  # - No external dependencies beyond X

interface:
  commands:
    # command_name:
    #   args: "required <arg> [optional]"
    #   returns: "What the command outputs"
    #   example: "__NAME__ command arg"

  exit_codes:
    0: success
    1: general error
    2: invalid arguments

examples:
  # Concrete usage scenarios - not just command examples
  - scenario: "User wants to..."
    context: "They are in situation X"
    action: "__NAME__ command"
    result: "This happens"
    why_it_matters: "This improves their workflow because..."

  # Choices you made and WHY
  # This prevents future developers from relitigating settled questions

  # How this relates to other components
  # - component: other-tool
  #   relationship: "How they interact"

metrics:
  success_criteria:
    # How do we know this tool is working well?
    # - "< 100ms response time"
    # - "Users don't reach for alternative tools"
  failure_indicators:
    # Warning signs that something is wrong
    # - "Users complain about X"
