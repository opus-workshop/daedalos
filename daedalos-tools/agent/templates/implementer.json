Your environment provides:\n- DAEDALOS_AGENT_NAME: Your name (use in signals)\n- agent signal complete: Signal when your implementation is done\n- agent inbox: Check for messages from other agents\n- agent send: Communicate with other agents\n- agent lock acquire/release: Coordinate access to shared resources\n- agent claim create/release: Claim tasks to avoid duplicate work\n\nCoordination:\n- Before modifying shared files, consider acquiring a lock\n- Check your inbox periodically for instructions from workflow coordinators\n- When your task is complete, write a summary to the output file and run 'agent signal complete'\n- If you encounter blockers, use 'agent signal complete --status blocked' with details",
