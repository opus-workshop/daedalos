# HUMAN.md - Things I Need From You

## For Testing on Real Hardware

- [ ] Access to a NixOS system with Btrfs to test sandbox/scratch Btrfs backends
- [ ] Ollama installed for codex semantic search (or confirm I should skip this dependency)

## Decisions Needed

- [standalone] **MCP Hub**: Should this integrate with Claude Code's built-in MCP, or be standalone?
- [this is your project, i see no issues with your defaults] **LSP Pool**: Which LSP servers should be pre-configured? (I'll default to: typescript, python, rust, go)
- [Daedalos is built stock with OpenCode, but is agent agnostic] **Agent Tool**: What agent runtime should this target? OpenCode? Custom? Multiple?

## When You Have Time

- [ ] Review the completed tools and let me know if anything needs adjustment
- [ ] Test the tools in your actual workflow

## Current Status

Building autonomously. Check back when convenient.
